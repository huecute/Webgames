GalagaDitto is a Galaga copy built for HTML
Game is mostly code from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript
There is one small edit on game, but due to what I believe is limitation on HTML it doesn't work well
GalagaDitto uses a lot of the logic in Game to help it get built, so credit goes to them
